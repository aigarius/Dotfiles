# Dotfiles for my Arch Linux workstation(s)

**So awesome they should be banned!**

## Requirements

You will need [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) (for Zsh) and [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) (for Vim).

You will probably want to execute my awesome script called `symlink.sh` that will make symlinks (what a surprise) to dotfiles where possible. It will mostly fail â€” fix it.
