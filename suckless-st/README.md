## Suckless st

I'm using [my own fork of st](https://github.com/daGrevis/suckless-st). You can
learn more about st in [their page](http://st.suckless.org/).

## Installation

Clone one of these repos:

* https://github.com/daGrevis/suckless-st
* http://git.suckless.org/st

Compile it:

    sudo make clean install

## Configuration

Edit `config.h` and recompile! I'm not a fan of this myself.

Good thing is that it recompiles instantly.

[My config can be found here!](https://github.com/daGrevis/suckless-st/blob/master/config.h)
